The local university is conducting an experiment with their first year psychology class, and they have tasked our team with developing the object model. The UI and persistence layers will be designed and developed by our offshore counterparts once the object model is completed.

The psychology class wants to test the ability of students to gauge, when presented with two shapes on a computer screen, if the two shapes consume the same area or not. So given a rectangle and a triangle, can a person accurately tell if the two shapes are of the same size? Can they tell if the two shapes are different in size?

In future iterations, the ability to document thresholds, that is, how close do two shapes need to be in size for a person to guage the area accurately is a potential feature, but that is not in scope for this iteration.

The shapes the psychology team has asked to include on the first iteration include:

Square
Rectangle
Circle
Triangle
Line
Point

When the object model is completed, please deliver it to the offshore team so they can begin UI and persistence level enhancements.
